# About

This website (https://www.rory-musinskas.com) is a reflection of my personality and a place for me to show off projects I am creating throughout my career. It is an update on my old portfolio (https://zealous-wing-31c1c0.netlify.app/).

# Tech used

1. React
2. CSS

# Learning goals

1. To practise very basic react components.
2. Consolidate and compare CSS skills compared to my first portfolio.
